/**
 * Functions, lesson 2.5
 * @author Mike Whitfield
 * 
 * In this module, you will understand functions a little better.  Functions are
 * labels that tell a code block to execute more than once.  Inside a computer
 * program, the processor is instructed to point to that function.
 * 
 * Functions may be customized by the inclusion of parameters.  Parameters are
 * just variables, remember.  In ES6, they may be initialized with default
 * values.
 * 
 * Functions always return to the context they were called from.  Functions
 * may return simple data, complex data, or even other functions.
