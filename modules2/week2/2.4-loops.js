/**
 * Loops, lesson 2.4
 * @author Mike Whitfield
 * 
 * Loops are blocks of code that run more than once.  Loops always have some 
 * termination logic, otherwise the loop would run forever.
 * 
 * Loops typically store state.  If a loop did not store state related to the
 * "current iteration", it might be hard to do something meaningful inside the
 * code block.
 * 
 * The easiest example of a loop is to iterate through an array or object.  
 * A second example of a loop is a program loop which terminates only when the 
 * user exits the program.
